\title{Generate random samples using Accept-Reject on a closed domain}
\usage{
accept_reject_rn(f, d, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{A function that accepts a numeric scalar or vector and returns the
(non-normalized allowed) density values on the same scale.}

\item{d}{Numeric vector of length 2 giving the closed domain c(lower, upper).}

\item{n}{Integer; number of draws desired.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of length \code{n} containing accepted draws.
}
\description{
This function implements the basic Accept/Reject algorithm for a target pdf
\code{f} supported on a closed interval \code{d = c(lower, upper)}. A rough maximum
is estimated by evaluating \code{f} on a grid; the estimate is slightly inflated
to provide a safety buffer.
}
\examples{
beta_pdf <- function(x) dbeta(x, 2, 5)
x <- accept_reject_rn(beta_pdf, c(0,1), 1000)
}
